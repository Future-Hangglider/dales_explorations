# dales_explorations
Work done with the Dutch Atmospheric Large Eddy Simulation to visualize thermals

The source code for dales and its examples is here:

A glance at this 30 page paper on the forumulation of the simulation should give an idea of its complexity

I've forgotten how I got this thing running, but I've found one notebook which I used to 
render the output with wind arrows and colours for up and down motion.
